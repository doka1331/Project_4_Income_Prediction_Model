# Project_4_Income_Prediction_Model
Hello and Welcome to our collection of Machine Learning Models
In this project, we use a collection of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models to split and test data 
to see which model would perform best in predicting whether or not an individual's income exceeds or does not exceed $50,000 yearly. 
The supervised models were used more for future predicting while the unsupervised machine learning models were used for data shape visualization.

Within the Folder titled "Completed_Script_Kang" is the "Resources" folder that contains both the cleaned and raw data. There is also an ETL script titled "ETL_Script.ipynb" that transforms that raw data into the cleaned data via Jupyter notebook and Pandas manipulation. The script "Supervised_Income_Regression_Model.ipynb" contains the script for my supervised machine logistic regression model that was used to predict if an individual's yearly income does not exceed, is equal to, or exceeds $50,000 based on their other recorded statistics. The script "Unsupervised_PCA_Model_Comparison_Kang.ipynb" contains the script for my base KMeans clustering unsupervised model as well as the script for my PCA KMeans clustering unsupervised model.
