# Project_4_Income_Prediction_Model
Hello and Welcome to our collection of Machine Learning Models
In this project, we use a collection of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models to split and test data 
to see which model would perform best in predicting whether or not an individual's income exceeds or does not exceed $50,000 yearly. 
The supervised models were used more for future predicting while the unsupervised machine learning models were used for data shape visualization.
